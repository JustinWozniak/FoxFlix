"#FoxFlix" 

React app built using the Internet Movie Database.
Working towards users being able to view favorite movies/acors. Also be able to search information as well. Maybe small reviews, and a rating system to come...

Going to get functionality working first, then focus on CSS

You know the drill....clone or download...then npm install...npm start;)
